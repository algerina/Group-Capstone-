# Group Capstone 

In this project we worked collaboratively as a Group to implement a web app wich shows information about movie shows 

The app fetches data from the tvmaze Api and users can interactively add likes to their favourite shows 

The greatest feature is making reservations and making comments and moreso read other people comments about the movie show 

If you like what you see and have a project you need coded, don't hesitate to contact us.
